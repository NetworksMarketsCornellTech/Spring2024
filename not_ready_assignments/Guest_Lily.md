**Title**: High-stakes decisions with low-quality data: Learning and planning under uncertainty for conservation

**Abstract**: Wildlife poaching pushes countless species to the brink of extinction, with animal population sizes declining by an average of 70% since 1970. To aid rangers in preventing poaching in protected areas around the world, we have developed the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS). We present technical advances in multi-armed bandits, robust reinforcement learning, and causal inference, guided by research questions that emerged from on-the-ground challenges in deploying PAWS. We also discuss bridging the gap between research and practice, from field tests in Uganda and Cambodia to large-scale deployment through integration with SMART, the leading software system for protected area management used by over 1,000 wildlife parks worldwide.

**Bio**: Lily Xu is a computer science PhD student at Harvard developing AI techniques to address environmental planning challenges. She focuses on advancing methods in machine learning, sequential decision-making, and game theory for biodiversity conservation through preventing wildlife poaching. Her work building the PAWS system to predict poaching hotspots has been deployed across Africa, southeast Asia, and Latin America and is being scaled globally through integration with SMART conservation software. Lily co-organizes the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) research initiative and serves as AI Lead for the SMART Partnership. Her research has been recognized with best paper runner-up at AAAI, the INFORMS Doing Good with Good OR award, and a Google PhD Fellowship.
