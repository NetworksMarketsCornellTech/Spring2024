VIRTUAL GUEST LECTURE

**Title**: Equitable Decision-Making in Public Resource Allocation

**Abstract**: Algorithmically guided decisions are becoming increasingly prevalent and, if left unchecked, can amplify pre-existing societal biases. In this talk, I audit the equity of decision-making in two public resource allocation settings. First, I present a methodological framework for online advertisers to determine a demographically equitable allocation of individuals being shown ads for SNAP (food stamp) benefits -- specifically, considering budget-constrained trade-offs between ad conversions for English-speaking and Spanish-speaking SNAP applicants. Second, I discuss sensitivity analyses on public funding allocation algorithms such as CalEnviroScreen, an algorithm used to promote environmental justice by aiding disadvantaged census tracts -- which we find to encode bias against tracts with high immigrant populations. In both case studies, we will discuss methods to mitigate allocative harm and to foster equitable outcomes using accountability mechanisms.

**Bio**: Allison Koenecke is an Assistant Professor of Information Science at Cornell University. Her research applies computational methods, such as machine learning and causal inference, to study societal inequities in domains from online services to public health. Koenecke is regularly quoted as an expert on disparities in automated speech-to-text systems. She previously held a postdoctoral researcher role at Microsoft Research and received her PhD from Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering.
