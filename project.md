As of 10/29/2023, this information has been updated for 2023.

Starting with Homework 2, the programming portion of each homework will build toward a final project, which will be an algorithmic recommendation and pricing competition. While the homeworks should be completed independently, the project may be done in groups of up to 4.

See [here for a _living document_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZodvaouesbLIxTJhdH5v6SaAJkz7430jSAXrrdZdJrM) with the project instructions. We will post an EdStem announcement whenever there are major changes/updates to the document.

See [here for a _strategy document_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJ4hGfudkZ83GqSOYcX7BD7Rt5r6GluR3mqiyQ4geec) for suggestions on how to complete each part of the project.

See [here for _submission instructions_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-s50XokhenJo-3Df1_lRTsMg0s4IDE9455qwcY45GY/edit?usp=sharing).

We recognize that students will heavily differ in terms of programming and data science experience entering the course, and the tournament is partially luck-driven. Thus, project grading will not primarily be based on your performance in the tournament -- rather, demonstrated effort and soundness of application of course concepts as discussed in the report will determine much of the project grade. Exceptional performance on the class project will warrant an A+ in the course.
