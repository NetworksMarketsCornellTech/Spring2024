**Title**: Algorithm design for social good: fair design and strategic interactions 

**Abstract**: In this talk, I will present my recent work on social aspects of algorithm design, encompassing two lines of work. In one line of work, we study methods for diagnosing when and why an algorithm is biased against societal minority groups, with applications to ranking algorithms and social influence. In another line of work, we study the impact of strategic interactions in social contexts, with a focus on precise error estimation of treatment effects in the presence of competition. In this talk, I will present theoretical challenges in designing algorithms that (1) do not amplify bias against minority groups and (2) are aware of strategic feedback from a population that aims to maximize its utility.
