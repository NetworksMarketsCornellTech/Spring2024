**Title** - Redesigning Recommendation on VolunteerMatch: Theory and Practice

**Abstract** – This work is the result of a multi-collaboration with VolunteerMatch (VM), the
largest platform in the United States connecting volunteers to organizations, to help them
redesign their recommendation system. VM has helped to facilitate over 10 million connections
and would ideally like to help all of its organizations find enough connections to fulfill their
needs. However, in practice many opportunities for volunteering get no connections and there is
a significant number of “wasted” or excess connections. Reallocating interest from opportunities
with too many volunteers to accommodate towards those not getting enough can significantly
improve welfare for all agents. We studied how VM can improve its recommendation system to
accomplish this reallocation and maximize useful sign-ups. Our contributions are both theoretical
and applied. On the theory side, we model a key feature of many online platforms – multi-
channel traffic – and design a new algorithm for this context with provable guarantees that are
near-optimal in some regimes. On the applied side, we designed and implemented a new
recommendation algorithm, SmartSort, which led to significant improvements in equity on VM’s
platform and provided insights into the equity-efficiency trade-off in the context of VM.
