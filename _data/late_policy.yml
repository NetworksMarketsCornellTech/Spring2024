policies:
  -  You will be allowed four total late days during the semester.  These late days allow you to turn in homework up to 24 hours late, with no penalty; you may also use all four late days on a single homework assignment (allowing you to turn it in up to 96 hours late), but that will leave you with no late days for other homework.
  -  When submitting homework late, please mark at the top how many late days are used for this assignment and how many you have used before, if any. 
  -  Late days cannot be used for any assignment other than homework.
